### Description:

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. This article focuses on detecting objects.

Object Detection is a computer technology related to computer vision, image processing, and deep learning that deals with detecting instances of objects in images and videos. We will do object detection in this article using something known as haar cascades.

YOLOv4 is a one-stage object detection model that improves on YOLOv3 with several bags of tricks and modules introduced in the literature. The components section below details the tricks and modules used.
